# Castlevania Order of Eclessia Remade

#### DISCLAIMER:
This is a remake of Castlevanie Order of Eclessia made in my first year (2022-2023) of learning C++ with a framework provided by Digital Arts & Entertainment, Howest.

## Proud work
This project is one of my proudest works for how much I grew. Many **programming patterns** were learnt during this project and it is my first attempt at dabbling into the **C++ standard**. The use of vectors and maps helped me understand a library used. **Nlohmann Json** (https://github.com/nlohmann/json) was the first library ported by myself for loading in the map, enemies, interactables, animations, etc... I wanted to dabble as much as I could with **external files feeding information**.

## Highlights
While the codebase is old it still hold dear to me. In particular the map loading (https://github.com/Mikail-Kahya/Castlevania/blob/main/Castlevania/Level.h) and animations (https://github.com/Mikail-Kahya/Castlevania/blob/main/Castlevania/TextureManager.h) have a special place in my heart. This is where I really went in depth with json library and external loading of files. This is also a great example of my first attempt at a Singleton which later in my education found out should be implemented differently. It truly shows how much I have grown.
